# Getting Started with the Dev-Docs Starter Template

The Dev-Docs Docusaurus starter template is designed to help you create your own documentation quickly and easily. Whether you're building public-facing documentation for your APIs, SDKs, or applications, or internal documentation for your software engineering organization, this template provides a solid foundation to get started.  This is a Docusaurus template that should retain most if not all the same functionality found outlined in the 

## Setting Up the Template

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the Dev-Docs starter template repository to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies and start the project**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running the appropriate command for your package manager: `npm install`.  Once installed run `npm run start`

3. **Customize the content**: The template comes with a basic structure and some sample content to help you get started. Modify the existing files or create new ones to suit your documentation needs.  To make your life easier you can use [Dev-Docs AI](https://dev-docs.dev/docs) with this template to automatically generate documentation or manually add new pages.  Remember at least one page as should have an index slug.  Learn more about document pages [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/3.2.1/create-doc).

4. **Configure the theme**: The template uses a modern and responsive theme out of the box, but you can customize it further by modifying the styles and layout according to your project's branding and requirements.

5. **Build and preview**: Use the provided build scripts to generate a static version of your documentation. Most static site generators also include a local development server, allowing you to preview your changes in real-time as you make them.

6. **Deploy**: Once you're satisfied with your documentation, deploy it to your preferred hosting platform. Many static site generators provide seamless integration with popular hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or AWS S3.

## Folder Structure

The Dev-Docs starter template follows a standard folder structure to help you organize your content:

- `docs/`: This directory contains the source files for your documentation, typically written in Markdown or another markup language supported by your chosen static site generator.
- `public/`: This directory is used to store the generated, static HTML files after the build process.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for any custom components, plugins, or scripts you might add to your documentation site.
- `static/`: This directory is for static assets like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files used by your documentation.

## Customization and Extensibility

The Dev-Docs starter template is built with extensibility in mind, allowing you to customize and enhance it according to your specific needs. You can:

- **Add new pages**: Create new Markdown files in the `docs/` directory to add more pages to your documentation.
- **Integrate with external services**: Leverage the extensibility of your chosen static site generator to integrate with external services like search engines, analytics tools, or comment systems.
- **Develop custom components**: Use the `src/` directory to develop custom React components, Vue components, or other reusable elements to enhance the functionality and user experience of your documentation.
- **Enhance the theme**: Modify the existing theme styles and layouts by editing the provided CSS and template files, or create your own custom theme from scratch.

By leveraging the Dev-Docs starter template, you can kickstart your documentation project and focus on creating high-quality content while benefiting from the flexibility and extensibility of modern static site generators.
