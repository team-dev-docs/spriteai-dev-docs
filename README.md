# Quick Start Guide

Hey there! Welcome to SpriteAI. Let's get you up and running in no time.

## What You'll Need

- A computer (obviously!)
- Python 3.7 or later installed
- A sense of adventure (optional, but recommended)

## Installation

First things first, let's get SpriteAI installed on your machine. It's as easy as pie:

```bash
pip install spriteai
```

Done? Great! Moving on...

## Your First SpriteAI Project

Alright, let's create something cool:

1. Fire up your favorite text editor or IDE.
2. Create a new Python file (let's call it `awesome_sprites.py`).
3. Copy and paste this code:

```python
from spriteai import SpriteGenerator

# Create a new sprite generator
generator = SpriteGenerator()

# Generate a random sprite
sprite = generator.generate_random()

# Save your masterpiece
sprite.save('my_awesome_sprite.png')
```

4. Save the file and run it:

```bash
python awesome_sprites.py
```

5. Check your directory - you should see a shiny new `my_awesome_sprite.png` file!

## What's Next?

You've just scratched the surface of what SpriteAI can do. Here are some ideas to keep the fun going:

- Try generating sprites with specific themes (e.g., `generator.generate(theme='space')`)
- Experiment with different sizes and colors
- Create a bunch of sprites and make a mini-game with them

Remember, the sky's the limit with SpriteAI. Have fun, and happy sprite-ing!
