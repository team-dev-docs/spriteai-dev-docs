# Getting Started with the Phaser Sample Game

This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and running the Phaser sample game included in our codebase. The game demonstrates fundamental Phaser functionality, including scene creation, sprite rendering, and player movement.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- A local web server (options include Python's SimpleHTTPServer, Node.js' http-server, or any equivalent web server)

## Project Structure

The project comprises three primary files:

1. `index.html`: The HTML file responsible for loading the Phaser library and our game scripts.
2. `game.js`: The main game configuration file.
3. `scenes/MainScene.js`: The primary game scene containing the core game logic.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.

3. Initiate your local web server in the project directory. For example:

   Using Python's SimpleHTTPServer:
   ```
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   Using Node.js' http-server:
   ```
   npx http-server
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port if configured differently).

## Understanding the Code

### Game Configuration

The `game.js` file contains the main Phaser game configuration:

```javascript
const config = {
    type: Phaser.AUTO,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    parent: 'game',
    physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: {
            gravity: { y: 0 },
            debug: false
        }
    },
    scene: MainScene
};

const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
```

This configuration establishes a game canvas with dimensions of 800x600 pixels, utilizes the Arcade physics system without gravity, and designates `MainScene` as the default scene.

### Main Scene

The `scenes/MainScene.js` file defines the game's main scene:

```javascript
class MainScene extends Phaser.Scene {
    constructor() {
        super({ key: 'MainScene' });
    }

    preload() {
        // Asset loading
    }

    create() {
        // Scene initialization
    }

    update() {
        // Game loop logic
    }
}
```

The `MainScene` class extends `Phaser.Scene` and implements three key methods:

- `preload()`: Loads game assets (in this instance, a simple colored rectangle serves as a placeholder sprite).
- `create()`: Initializes the game state, creates the player sprite, and sets up input controls.
- `update()`: Executes continuously, managing player movement based on input.

## Running the Game

After setting up the local server and opening the game in your web browser, you should see a blue rectangle representing the player. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the player's movement.

## Next Steps

With the basic Phaser game operational, consider the following enhancements:

1. Replace the player sprite with an actual image.
2. Introduce obstacles or collectibles to the game environment.
3. Implement a scoring system or win/lose conditions.
4. Explore Phaser's documentation to leverage more advanced features and capabilities.

We encourage you to experiment with the code and expand upon this foundation. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please consult our additional documentation or reach out to the development team.

Happy game development!
