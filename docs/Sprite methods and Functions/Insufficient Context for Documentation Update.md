  I apologize, but I don't have enough context from the provided code snippet to generate a complete and accurate documentation update. The code you shared is a `beforeEach` block from a test file, which doesn't provide information about the actual function or method being tested.

To properly update the documentation, I would need more details about the specific function or class that this test is associated with. The test setup alone doesn't give me enough information about the function's purpose, parameters, prerequisites, or usage.

If you could provide the actual implementation code for the function being tested, or more details about what the `removeBackground` function does, I'd be able to create a more accurate and helpful documentation update.
