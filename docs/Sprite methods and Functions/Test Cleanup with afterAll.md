  Based on the provided code snippet, there isn't enough information to update the documentation for a specific function or method. The code you've shared is a test cleanup function using `afterAll`, which is typically part of a test suite setup rather than the actual function being documented.

Without more context about the specific function or class that needs documentation, I can't generate the requested updates. The code snippet doesn't provide details about parameters, prerequisites, or usage of any particular function that would be part of the SDK.

If you could provide more information about the specific function or class you want documented, I'd be happy to help create appropriate documentation following your guidelines.
