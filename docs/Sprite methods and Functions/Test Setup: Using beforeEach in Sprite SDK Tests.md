  Based on the provided code context, I don't have enough information to update the documentation for a specific function or method. The code snippet you shared is a `beforeEach` block from a test file, which is used to set up the test environment before each test case runs. It doesn't provide details about a specific function that would be part of the Sprite SDK.

To properly update the documentation, I would need information about the actual function being tested or the main functionality of the Sprite SDK. The test setup alone doesn't give enough context to create meaningful documentation for a user-facing function.

If you can provide more context about the specific function or feature you want documented, I'd be happy to help create appropriate documentation following the guidelines you've outlined.
