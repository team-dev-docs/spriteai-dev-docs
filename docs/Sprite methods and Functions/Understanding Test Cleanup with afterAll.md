  I apologize, but I don't have enough context from the provided code snippet to generate a comprehensive documentation update for a specific function or method. The code you shared is a cleanup function using `afterAll` in what appears to be a test file. It doesn't provide information about a specific SDK function that needs documentation.

To properly update the documentation as requested, I would need more information about the actual function or method that needs to be documented, including its purpose, parameters, prerequisites, and usage examples.

Without this additional context, I cannot reliably update the documentation template you provided while adhering to your instructions, especially the crucial rule of not generating information that doesn't reflect the current code and context.

If you can provide more details about the specific function or method you want documented, I'd be happy to assist in creating appropriate documentation.
