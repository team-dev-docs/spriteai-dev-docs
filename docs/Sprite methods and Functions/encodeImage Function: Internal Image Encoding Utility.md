  # **encodeImage Function**

High Level

This is a utility function that is part of our Node.js SDK. While it's not directly exported for user import, it plays a crucial role in image processing within the SDK.

## Why should I use this function?

The `encodeImage` function is used internally to convert image files into base64-encoded strings. This encoding is often necessary when you need to transmit image data over text-based protocols or include image data in JSON payloads.

## What parameters or arguments are required?

The function requires one parameter:
- `imagePath`: A string representing the file path to the image you want to encode.

## Prerequisites

To use this function effectively, ensure you have:
1. Node.js installed on your system
2. The `fs` (File System) module available, which is a built-in Node.js module

## How do I use this function?

While this function is primarily for internal use within the SDK, here's how it works:

1. The function reads the specified image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It then converts the file contents into a base64-encoded string.

Here's an example of how it might be used internally:

```javascript
const encodedImage = encodeImage('/path/to/your/image.jpg');
// encodedImage now contains the base64 representation of the image
```

Note: As this function is not directly exposed in the SDK's public interface, you typically wouldn't call it directly in your application code. Instead, it's used by other SDK functions that handle image processing and API interactions.
