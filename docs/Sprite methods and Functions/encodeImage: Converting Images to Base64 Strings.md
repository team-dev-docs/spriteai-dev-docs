  # **encodeImage Function**

High Level

This is a utility function that is part of our Node.js SDK. While it's not directly exported for user import, it plays a crucial role in image processing within the SDK.

## Why should I use this function?

The `encodeImage` function is designed to convert image files into base64-encoded strings. This encoding is often necessary when you need to transmit image data over text-based protocols or include image data directly in JSON payloads.

## What are the parameters or arguments required?

The function takes a single parameter:

- `imagePath` (string): The file path to the image you want to encode.

## Prerequisites

To use this function effectively, ensure you have:

1. Node.js installed on your system
2. The `fs` (File System) module available, which is a core Node.js module
3. Proper read permissions for the image file you're trying to encode

## How do I use this function?

While this function is not directly exposed for import, it's used internally within the SDK. However, understanding its functionality can help you work with image-related features of the SDK. Here's how it works:

1. The function reads the image file from the provided path using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It then converts the file contents into a Buffer.
3. Finally, it encodes the Buffer to a base64 string.

Example of how it might be used internally:

```javascript
const encodedImage = encodeImage('/path/to/your/image.jpg');
// encodedImage now contains the base64-encoded string of the image
```

This encoded string can then be used in various SDK operations that require image data in a text-based format.

Note: Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to read the image files you're working with, and be mindful of memory usage when encoding large images.
