# Text Generation API Overview

## Introduction

SpriteAI's Text Generation API is a powerful tool designed to generate high-quality, contextually relevant text based on user input. This overview will provide you with a basic understanding of how our text generation API works and how to integrate it into your projects.

## How It Works

Our text generation API utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate human-like text. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Input Processing**: The API receives your text input and processes it to understand the context and requirements.
2. **Model Selection**: Based on the input, the API selects the most appropriate language model for the task.
3. **Text Generation**: The selected model generates text that matches the input context and requirements.
4. **Output Refinement**: The generated text is refined to ensure coherence and relevance.
5. **Response Delivery**: The final generated text is returned as the API response.

## Basic Usage

To use the Text Generation API, you'll need to install the SpriteAI package and initialize it in your project. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const spriteAI = require('spriteai');

// Initialize the Text Generation API
const textGen = new spriteAI.TextGeneration();

// Generate text
textGen.generateText('Write a short story about a robot')
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Generated text:', response.text);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Text generation error:', error);
  });
```

## Key Features

1. **Contextual Understanding**: Our API understands the context of your input to generate relevant text.
2. **Customizable Output**: You can specify parameters such as length, tone, and style of the generated text.
3. **Multiple Languages**: Support for text generation in various languages.
4. **Real-time Generation**: Fast and efficient text generation for real-time applications.
