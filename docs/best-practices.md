# Best Practices for Using SpriteAI

This document outlines the best practices for using the SpriteAI library to generate game assets efficiently and effectively.

## 1. Character Spritesheet Generation

When using the `generateCharacterSpritesheet` function, consider the following best practices:

### 1.1 Customizing Animation States

- Use the `states` option to define specific animation states for your character:

```javascript
const options = {
  states: ['idle', 'walk', 'run', 'attack', 'jump']
};
await generateCharacterSpritesheet('warrior', options);
```

- Stick to common animation states for consistency across characters.
- Use `fetchAvailableAnimationStates()` to get a list of supported states.

### 1.2 Optimizing Sprite Size and Quality

- Choose an appropriate `size` for your spritesheet based on your game's resolution:

```javascript
const options = {
  size: '2048x2048'
};
```

- Balance between quality and file size to optimize performance.

### 1.3 Consistent Style

- Use the `style` option to maintain a consistent art style across your game:

```javascript
const options = {
  style: 'pixel-art'
};
```

- Use `fetchAvailableSpriteStyles()` to get a list of supported styles.

## 2. Environment Sprite Generation

When using the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, follow these practices:

### 2.1 Thematic Consistency

- Use the `theme` option to ensure your environment matches your game's setting:

```javascript
const options = {
  theme: 'fantasy',
  elements: 6
};
await generateEnvironmentSprites('forest', options);
```

### 2.2 Tileset Optimization

- Adjust the `elements` option based on the variety needed in your environment.
- Use consistent sizes for easy tiling in your game engine.

## 3. Item Sprite Generation

For `generateItemSprites`, consider these best practices:

### 3.1 Item Categorization

- Use the `itemType` option to generate cohesive sets of items:

```javascript
const options = {
  itemType: 'weapons',
  itemCount: 8
};
await generateItemSprites('medieval', options);
```

### 3.2 Background Considerations

- Choose an appropriate `background` option based on your game's UI:

```javascript
const options = {
  background: 'transparent'
};
```

## 4. General Best Practices

### 4.1 Error Handling

- Always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks to handle potential errors gracefully:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await generateCharacterSpritesheet('hero');
  // Process the result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error generating spritesheet:', error);
  // Handle the error appropriately
}
```

### 4.2 Asset Management

- Use the `save` option to automatically save generated assets:

```javascript
const options = {
  save: true
};
```

- Implement a naming convention for saved files to keep your asset folder organized.

### 4.3 Prompt Engineering

- Provide clear and detailed descriptions when generating sprites to get the best results.
- Experiment with different prompts to fine-tune the output to your needs.

### 4.4 Performance Optimization

- Generate and save assets during development or as part of your build process rather than at runtime.
- Cache generated assets to avoid unnecessary API calls and improve load times.

By following these best practices, you can effectively use the SpriteAI library to create high-quality, consistent game assets while optimizing performance and maintainability of your game project.
