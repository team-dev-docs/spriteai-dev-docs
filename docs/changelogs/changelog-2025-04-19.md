# Getting Started with SpriteAI: A Quick Guide for Game Developers

Are you a game developer looking to streamline your sprite creation process? Look no further! SpriteAI is here to revolutionize the way you generate game assets. In this quick guide, we'll walk you through the basics of using SpriteAI to create stunning sprites for your games.

## What is SpriteAI?

SpriteAI is a powerful Node.js library that leverages artificial intelligence to generate high-quality sprites based on text descriptions. Whether you're creating characters, items, or environments, SpriteAI has got you covered.

## Installation

Getting started with SpriteAI is a breeze. Simply install it using npm:

```bash
npm install spriteai
```

## Basic Usage

Let's dive into the core functionality of SpriteAI with a simple example:

```javascript
const sprite = require('spriteai');

async function createSimpleSprite() {
  const description = 'A cute pixel art cat';
  const generatedSprite = await sprite.generateSprite(description);
  console.log(generatedSprite);
}

createSimpleSprite();
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to generate a sprite of a cute pixel art cat. The `generateSprite` function takes a text description and returns a base64-encoded image.

## Advanced Features

### Customizing Sprite Generation

SpriteAI offers various options to fine-tune your sprite generation:

```javascript
const options = {
  size: 64,
  style: 'pixel art',
  colors: ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
  background: 'transparent'
};

const customSprite = await sprite.generateSprite('A magical wizard', options);
```

### Generating Multiple Sprites

Need to create a batch of sprites? SpriteAI has you covered:

```javascript
const descriptions = [
  'A fierce dragon',
  'A mystical unicorn',
  'A brave knight'
];

const sprites = await Promise.all(descriptions.map(desc => sprite.generateSprite(desc)));
```

### Adding Borders to Sprites

Want to give your sprites a distinct outline? Try the `generateSpriteWithBorder` function:

```javascript
const borderColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, alpha: 255 }; // Red border
const borderThickness = 2;

const borderedSprite = await sprite.generateSpriteWithBorder('A glowing potion', borderColor, borderThickness);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your description, the better the AI can interpret your vision.
2. **Experiment with Styles**: Try different style options to find what works best for your game's aesthetic.
3. **Batch Processing**: When possible, generate multiple sprites in parallel to save time.
4. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling to manage potential API issues or unexpected results.

## Conclusion

SpriteAI is a game-changer for developers looking to speed up their asset creation process. With its intuitive API and powerful AI-driven generation, you can focus more on game mechanics and less on pixel-perfect art creation.
