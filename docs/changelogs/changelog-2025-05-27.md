# Changelog: May 27, 2025 - Spicing Up SpriteAI with New Character Generation Features!

## üå∂Ô∏è Hot New Features

### 1. Ninja Stealth Mode Activated!
We've snuck in a new `generateNinja()` function that'll have you throwing pixel shurikens in no time! This sneaky addition comes with:
- 5 stealthy states: idle, walk, run, attack, and sneak
- Default pixel-art style (because ninjas are old-school cool)
- 6 frames per state for smooth shadow-melting animations

```javascript
export const generateNinja = async function(options = {}) {
  const defaultOptions = {
    states: ['idle', 'walk', 'run', 'attack', 'sneak'],
    style: 'pixel-art',
    framesPerState: 6
  };
  const mergedOptions = { ...defaultOptions, ...options };
  
  return generateCharacterSpritesheet('ninja character with black outfit and mask', mergedOptions);
};
```

### 2. Blast Off with Spaceman Sprites!
Houston, we have liftoff! The new `generateSpaceman()` function is ready for your cosmic adventures:
- 4 gravity-defying states: idle, walk, run, and float
- Pixel-perfect astronaut suits and helmets
- 6 frames per state for smooth lunar landings

```javascript
export const generateSpaceman = async function(options = {}) {
  const defaultOptions = {
    states: ['idle', 'walk', 'run', 'float'],
    style: 'pixel-art',
    framesPerState: 6
  };
  const mergedOptions = { ...defaultOptions, ...options };
  
  return generateCharacterSpritesheet('astronaut character with space suit and helmet', mergedOptions);
};
```

### 3. Robots Roll Out!
Beep boop, baby! Our new `generateRobot()` function is here to mechanize your game:
- 5 electrifying states: idle, walk, run, attack, and power-up
- Shiny pixel-art style by default
- 6 frames per state for smooth servo movements

```javascript
export const generateRobot = async function(options = {}) {
  const defaultOptions = {
    states: ['idle', 'walk', 'run', 'attack', 'power-up'],
    style: 'pixel-art',
    framesPerState: 6
  };
  const mergedOptions = { ...defaultOptions, ...options };
  
  return generateCharacterSpritesheet('robot character with mechanical limbs and glowing eyes', mergedOptions);
};
```

## üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è Why It's Spicy

1. **Instant Character Variety**: With just a few lines of code, you can now generate ninjas, spacemen, and robots. It's like having a character buffet at your fingertips!

2. **Customization is King**: Each new function comes with default options, but you're not locked in. Want a 3D-style ninja or a hand-drawn astronaut? Just tweak the options!

3. **Consistency Across the Board**: All new functions use the battle-tested `generateCharacterSpritesheet()` under the hood, ensuring reliable and consistent results.

4. **Performance Boost**: By providing specific character types, we've optimized the prompts for faster and more accurate sprite generation.

## üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è How to Spice Up Your Game

1. **Ninja Stealth Game**: Use `generateNinja()` to create a stealthy protagonist for your next sneaky adventure game.

2. **Space Exploration**: Combine `generateSpaceman()` with our existing environment generation to create an out-of-this-world space exploration game.

3. **Robot Uprising**: Build an army of diverse robots using `generateRobot()` with different options for a futuristic strategy game.

4. **Character Mashup**: Mix and match all three new character types in a genre-bending, dimension-hopping epic!

## üßØ Cool Down Notes

- Remember, these new functions are built on top of our existing sprite generation system. They inherit all the power and flexibility of `generateCharacterSpritesheet()`.
- Default options are just suggestions. Feel free to experiment with different states, styles, and frame counts to find what works best for your game.
- As always, keep an eye on your API usage. These spicy new features are hot, but don't let them burn through your quota!
