# CI/CD Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow implemented in our project using GitHub Actions. The workflow automates the process of building, testing, and deploying our application, ensuring code quality and streamlining the release process.

## Workflow Trigger

The CI/CD workflow is triggered on the following events:
- Push to the `main` branch
- Pull requests targeting the `main` branch

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Checkout Repository
- Action: `actions/checkout@v2`
- Purpose: Clones the repository to the GitHub Actions runner

### 2. Set up Node.js
- Action: `actions/setup-node@v2`
- Purpose: Installs Node.js on the runner
- Version: Uses the version specified in the project's `.nvmrc` file

### 3. Install Dependencies
- Command: `npm ci`
- Purpose: Installs project dependencies using a clean install

### 4. Run Linter
- Command: `npm run lint`
- Purpose: Checks code style and identifies potential errors

### 5. Run Unit Tests
- Command: `npm test`
- Purpose: Executes the project's unit test suite

### 6. Build Application
- Command: `npm run build`
- Purpose: Compiles and builds the application for production

### 7. Deploy to Staging (Only on push to main)
- Condition: `github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`
- Action: Custom deployment script or service (e.g., `deploy-to-staging.sh`)
- Purpose: Deploys the application to the staging environment

### 8. Run Integration Tests (On staging)
- Condition: Deployment to staging was successful
- Command: `npm run test:integration`
- Purpose: Executes integration tests against the staging environment

### 9. Deploy to Production (Manual trigger)
- Type: Manual workflow dispatch
- Action: Custom deployment script or service (e.g., `deploy-to-production.sh`)
- Purpose: Deploys the application to the production environment after manual approval

## Error Handling

If any step in the workflow fails:
- The workflow is terminated
- GitHub Actions marks the run as failed
- Notifications are sent to the development team (if configured)

## Artifacts

The workflow generates and stores the following artifacts:
- Build output
- Test results
- Linter report

These artifacts are available for download and inspection after each workflow run.

## Security Considerations

- Secrets and sensitive data are stored as GitHub Secrets and accessed securely within the workflow
- Third-party actions are pinned to specific versions to prevent supply chain attacks

## Monitoring and Logging

- Workflow runs can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab of the repository
- Detailed logs are available for each step of the workflow
- Integration with external monitoring tools can be set up for advanced alerting and dashboards
