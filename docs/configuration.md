# Configuration

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the configuration options available for SpriteAI. Proper configuration ensures optimal performance and customization of the SpriteAI package to suit your project needs.

## Basic Configuration

When initializing a new SpriteAI instance, you can pass a configuration object to customize its behavior. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const spriteAI = require('spriteai');

const config = {
  // Configuration options go here
};

const ai = new spriteAI.SpriteAI(config);
```

## Configuration Options

While the current documentation doesn't provide specific configuration options, here are some general guidelines for configuring SpriteAI:

1. **Default Sprite Dimensions**: You may be able to set default width and height for generated sprites.
2. **Output Format**: Configure the default output format for saved sprites (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
3. **AI Model Selection**: If multiple AI models are available, you might be able to specify which one to use.
4. **Performance Settings**: Options to balance between generation speed and quality.

Please refer to the API documentation for a comprehensive list of available configuration options.

## Environment Variables

SpriteAI may use environment variables for certain configurations, especially for sensitive information like API keys. Consult the API documentation for any required environment variables.

## Advanced Configuration

For more complex use cases, SpriteAI might offer advanced configuration options. These could include:

- Custom sprite templates
- Integration with specific game engines or frameworks
- Performance tuning for large-scale sprite generation

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on advanced configuration options.

## Best Practices

1. Always provide explicit configurations rather than relying on defaults when possible.
2. Keep sensitive information (like API keys) in environment variables, not in your code.
3. Regularly check the official documentation for updates to configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your configuration:

1. Double-check that all options are correctly spelled and formatted.
2. Ensure that your SpriteAI version supports the configuration options you're using.
3. Consult the troubleshooting guide or reach out to the community forums for assistance.

For more detailed information on configuration options and their effects, please refer to the API Reference section of the documentation.
