# Implementing User Authentication with Our SDK

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions for integrating user authentication using the SDK's `authenticateUser()` method.

## Before You Begin

- Verify that you've installed and configured the SDK in your project.
- Review the SDK's basic structure and functionality.

## Implementation Guide

1. Include the required SDK components:

```javascript
import { authenticateUser } from 'sdk-auth-module';
```

2. Set up the user's login information:

```javascript
const userEmail = 'jane.doe@example.com';
const userPassword = 'MyStr0ngP@ssw0rd!';
```

3. Execute the authentication process:

```javascript
try {
  const authResponse = await authenticateUser(userEmail, userPassword);
  if (authResponse.isAuthenticated) {
    console.log('Login successful');
    // Continue with post-authentication logic
  } else {
    console.warn('Login failed:', authResponse.errorMessage);
    // Handle failed authentication attempt
  }
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Authentication process error:', err);
  // Manage unexpected authentication errors
}
```

4. Process the authentication outcome:
   - A successful authentication is indicated by `authResponse.isAuthenticated` being `true`.
   - For failed attempts, examine `authResponse.errorMessage` to determine the cause.

5. Develop appropriate UI feedback and error management based on authentication results.

## Security Recommendations

- Utilize SSL/TLS encryption for all credential transmissions.
- Employ secure hashing algorithms for password storage.
- Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed attempts.
- Consider integrating two-factor authentication for heightened security.

## Resolving Common Issues

If authentication problems occur:

1. Verify the accuracy of the entered email and password.
2. Confirm that the SDK initialization was successful.
3. Test your internet connectivity.
4. Ensure the user account is valid and not suspended.
