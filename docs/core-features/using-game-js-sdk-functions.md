## Introduction

The 'game.js' SDK provides a set of functions to help you create and customize game scenarios easily. This guide assumes you have already set up the basic project structure and included the necessary files.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have included the 'game.js' file in your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/game.js"></script>
```

## Creating a New Game Scene

To create a new game scene, use the `createScene()` function:

```javascript
const scene = createScene('MainScene');
```

This will create a new scene object that you can customize and add elements to.

## Customizing Game Elements

### Adding a Background

To add a background to your scene, use the `addBackground()` function:

```javascript
scene.addBackground('background.png');
```

### Creating Characters

To create characters in your game, use the `createCharacter()` function:

```javascript
const player = scene.createCharacter('player', {
  x: 100,
  y: 200,
  sprite: 'player_sprite.png'
});
```

### Adding Objects

To add interactive objects to your scene, use the `addObject()` function:

```javascript
const treasure = scene.addObject('treasure', {
  x: 300,
  y: 150,
  sprite: 'treasure_chest.png'
});
```

## Adding Interactivity

### Handling User Input

To handle user input, use the `onKeyPress()` function:

```javascript
scene.onKeyPress('ArrowRight', () => {
  player.moveRight(5);
});
```

### Collision Detection

To detect collisions between game elements, use the `onCollision()` function:

```javascript
scene.onCollision(player, treasure, () => {
  console.log('Player found the treasure!');
  // Add your reward logic here
});
```

## Testing Your Game

To test your game, use the `startGame()` function:

```javascript
startGame(scene);
```

This will initialize your game with the created scene and start the game loop.

Remember to save your changes and refresh your browser to see the updates in your game.

By following these steps and utilizing the functions provided by the 'game.js' SDK, you can create and customize engaging game scenarios for your project. Experiment with different combinations of elements and interactions to create unique gaming experiences.
