# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
The `encodeImage` function converts an image file to a base64-encoded string representation.

## Usage
To use `encodeImage`, you need to import it from the module where it's defined and provide the path to the image file you want to encode.

```javascript
import { encodeImage } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The file path to the image that you want to encode.

## Return Value
Returns a string containing the base64-encoded representation of the image.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const encodedImage = encodeImage('./images/myImage.png');
console.log(encodedImage);
// Output: Base64 string representation of the image
```

### Using the Encoded Image in HTML
```javascript
const imagePath = './assets/logo.jpg';
const encodedImage = encodeImage(imagePath);
const imgElement = `<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,${encodedImage}" alt="Encoded Image">`;
```

## Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and the file exists.
- The function uses synchronous file reading, which may block the main thread for large files. Consider using an asynchronous version for better performance in production environments.
- The encoded string can be significantly longer than the original file size, so be mindful when working with large images.
- This function is useful for embedding images directly in HTML or sending image data over networks without separate file transfers.
