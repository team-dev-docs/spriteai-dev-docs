# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
The `encodeImage` function converts an image file to a base64-encoded string representation. This function is useful for embedding images directly in HTML or sending image data over networks without separate file transfers.

## Usage
To use `encodeImage`, import it from the module where it's defined and provide the path to the image file you want to encode.

```javascript
import { encodeImage } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The file path to the image that you want to encode.

## Return Value
Returns a Promise that resolves to a string containing the base64-encoded representation of the image.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const encodedImage = await encodeImage('./images/myImage.png');
console.log(encodedImage);
// Output: Base64 string representation of the image
```

### Using the Encoded Image in HTML
```javascript
const imagePath = './assets/logo.jpg';
const encodedImage = await encodeImage(imagePath);
const imgElement = `<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,${encodedImage}" alt="Encoded Image">`;
```

## Notes and Considerations
- Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and the file exists.
- The function now uses asynchronous file reading, which improves performance and prevents blocking the main thread for large files.
- The encoded string can be significantly longer than the original file size, so be mindful when working with large images.
- This function supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and WebP.
- If you need to resize or transform the image before encoding, consider using the `transformSprite` function from the image processing module.

## Related Functions
- `transformSprite`: For resizing or applying other transformations to an image before encoding.
- `colorizeSprite`: If you need to apply color manipulations to the image before encoding.
- `applyEffects`: For adding visual effects like outlines, shadows, or glows to the image before encoding.

Remember to handle any potential errors when using this function, as file operations can sometimes fail due to permissions or other issues.
