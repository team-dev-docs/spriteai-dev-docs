# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
Unleash the power of image encoding with the `encodeImage` function! This digital alchemist transmutes your ordinary image files into magical base64-encoded string representations.

## Usage
Summon the `encodeImage` function from its mystical module and feed it the path to the image you wish to transform.

```javascript
import { encodeImage } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The sacred scroll (file path) leading to the image you desire to encode.

## Return Value
Behold! A string containing the base64-encoded representation of your image, ready to be wielded in your digital quests.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const encodedImage = encodeImage('./images/epicScreenshot.png');
console.log(encodedImage);
// Output: A mesmerizing string of base64 characters, representing your image in its full glory
```

### Using the Encoded Image in HTML
```javascript
const imagePath = './assets/logo_of_doom.jpg';
const encodedImage = encodeImage(imagePath);
const imgElement = ``;
```

## Notes or Considerations
- Double-check your spellcasting! Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and the file exists, lest you summon a dreaded 'File Not Found' error.
- Beware! This function uses synchronous file reading, which may temporarily freeze the main thread for large files. Consider crafting an asynchronous version for enhanced performance in production realms.
- The encoded string can grow to monstrous proportions, far larger than the original file size. Exercise caution when dealing with images of epic proportions.
- Harness the power of `encodeImage` to embed images directly in HTML or to transmit image data across networks without the need for separate file transfers. It's like teleportation for your images!
