# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
The `encodeImage` function converts an image file to a base64-encoded string representation.

## Usage
To use `encodeImage`, you need to import the `fs` module and call the function with the path to the image file you want to encode.

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';

const encodedImage = encodeImage('path/to/your/image.png');
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The file path to the image you want to encode.

## Return Value
Returns a string containing the base64-encoded representation of the image.

## Examples
1. Encoding a PNG image:

```javascript
const encodedPNG = encodeImage('./assets/sprite.png');
console.log(encodedPNG); // Outputs: base64 encoded string
```

2. Encoding a JPEG image and using it in an HTML img tag:

```javascript
const encodedJPEG = encodeImage('./photos/profile.jpg');
const imgTag = `<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,${encodedJPEG}" alt="Profile Picture">`;
```

## Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and the file exists, otherwise an error will be thrown.
- The function uses synchronous file reading, which may block the main thread for large files. Consider using an asynchronous version for better performance in production environments.
- The resulting base64 string can be significantly larger than the original file size. Be cautious when encoding large images, as it may impact memory usage and performance.
- This function is typically used for small images or when you need to embed image data directly in your application code or data structures.
