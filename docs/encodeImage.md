# encodeImage Documentation

## Brief Description
The `encodeImage` function is your secret weapon for transforming mundane image files into powerful base64-encoded string representations. Get ready to unleash the full potential of your images!

## Usage
To harness the power of `encodeImage`, summon it from its mystical module and provide the sacred path to the image file you wish to encode.

```javascript
import { encodeImage } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The chosen path to your image, destined for encoding greatness.

## Return Value
Behold! A string containing the base64-encoded representation of your image, ready to conquer the digital realm.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const encodedImage = encodeImage('./images/epicImage.png');
console.log(encodedImage);
// Output: A mesmerizing base64 string representation of your image
```

### Using the Encoded Image in HTML
```javascript
const imagePath = './assets/logo-of-legends.jpg';
const encodedImage = encodeImage(imagePath);
const imgElement = ``;
```

## Notes or Considerations
- Ensure that the file path provided to `encodeImage` is correct and the file exists, lest you summon the dreaded 'File Not Found' demon.
- The function uses synchronous file reading, which may momentarily freeze time (block the main thread) for large files. Consider unleashing an asynchronous version for better performance in high-stakes production environments.
- Beware! The encoded string can grow to legendary proportions, far surpassing the original file size. Exercise caution when dealing with colossal images.
- This function is the ultimate tool for embedding images directly in HTML or teleporting image data across networks without separate file transfers. Use its power wisely!
