# Error Handling: Large File Uploads

When working with SpriteAI, you may encounter situations where you need to handle large file uploads. This guide will provide you with best practices and techniques for managing errors that can occur during this process.

## Understanding the Challenges

Uploading large files can present several challenges:

1. Timeouts
2. Memory limitations
3. Network interruptions
4. File size restrictions

It's important to implement robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience and maintain the integrity of your application.

## Implementing Error Handling

When working with SpriteAI's file upload functionality, you can use the following approach to handle potential errors:

```javascript
const spriteAI = require('spriteai');
const ai = new spriteAI.SpriteAI();

async function uploadLargeSprite(filePath) {
  try {
    const sprite = await ai.loadSprite(filePath);
    console.log('Large sprite successfully loaded:', sprite);
    // Further processing...
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof spriteAI.FileSizeError) {
      console.error('File size exceeds the maximum limit:', error.message);
      // Handle file size error (e.g., notify user, suggest file compression)
    } else if (error instanceof spriteAI.NetworkError) {
      console.error('Network error occurred during upload:', error.message);
      // Handle network error (e.g., retry upload, check connection)
    } else if (error instanceof spriteAI.TimeoutError) {
      console.error('Upload timed out:', error.message);
      // Handle timeout (e.g., increase timeout limit, suggest smaller file)
    } else {
      console.error('An unexpected error occurred:', error.message);
      // Handle other errors
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

To minimize errors when handling large file uploads:

1. **Implement file size checks**: Validate the file size before attempting to upload.
2. **Use chunked uploads**: Break large files into smaller chunks for more reliable uploading.
3. **Provide progress feedback**: Keep users informed about the upload progress.
4. **Implement retry mechanisms**: Automatically retry failed uploads when appropriate.
5. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Adjust timeout settings based on expected file sizes and network conditions.

## Conclusion

By implementing robust error handling for large file uploads, you can significantly improve the reliability and user experience of your SpriteAI-powered application. Always test your error handling thoroughly with various file sizes and network conditions to ensure it performs as expected.
