## New Feature: generateItemSprites

In this week's Feature Friday, we're excited to introduce the new `generateItemSprites` function. This powerful addition to our sprite generation toolkit allows developers to create customized item sprites for games and applications.

### Function Overview

The `generateItemSprites` function generates a collection of item sprites based on a given description and various customizable options.

```javascript
export const generateItemSprites = async function(description, options = {}) {
  // Function implementation
}
```

### Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the items to generate.
- `options` (object, optional): An object containing various customization options:
  - `itemCount` (number): Number of items to generate (default: 4)
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: '1024x1024')
  - `style` (string): Style of the items (default: 'pixel-art')
  - `padding` (number): Padding between items (default: 1)
  - `itemType` (string): Type of items to generate (default: 'equipment')
  - `background` (string): Background color (default: 'white')

### Return Value

The function returns an object containing:
- `original`: URL of the original generated image
- `itemSheet`: Base64-encoded image data of the processed item sheet
- `metadata`: Object containing information about the generated items

### Usage Example

```javascript
const result = await generateItemSprites("fantasy weapons", {
  itemCount: 6,
  style: 'pixel-art',
  itemType: 'weapons'
});

console.log(result.metadata);
console.log(result.itemSheet); // Base64-encoded image data
```

This new feature enables developers to quickly generate consistent and customizable item sprites for their games or applications, streamlining the asset creation process and enhancing visual coherence.
