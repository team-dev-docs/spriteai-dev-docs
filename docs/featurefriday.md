## New Feature Highlight: generateItemSprites

In this week's Feature Friday, we're excited to introduce the new `generateItemSprites` function. This powerful addition to our sprite generation capabilities allows developers to create customized item sprites for games and applications.

### Key Features of generateItemSprites

- **Customizable Item Count**: Generate multiple item sprites in a single call.
- **Flexible Styling**: Support for various art styles, including pixel art.
- **Item Type Specification**: Tailor sprites for different types of items (e.g., equipment, consumables).
- **Background Options**: Choose between transparent or custom background colors.
- **Responsive Design**: Generated sprites are suitable for various display sizes and resolutions.

### Usage Example

```javascript
const result = await generateItemSprites("medieval weapons", {
  itemCount: 6,
  style: 'pixel-art',
  itemType: 'equipment',
  background: 'transparent'
});

console.log(result.itemSheet); // Base64-encoded image data URL
console.log(result.metadata); // Metadata about the generated sprites
```

This new function enhances our sprite generation capabilities, allowing for more diverse and tailored item representations in game development projects.
