# fetchAvailableAnimationStates Documentation

## Introduction

The `fetchAvailableAnimationStates` function is a new addition to our SDK, designed to help developers retrieve the list of available animation states that can be used in conjunction with sprite generation functions. This documentation will guide you through the usage and implementation of this function.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A working development environment set up.
- The latest version of our SDK installed.

## Usage

To use `fetchAvailableAnimationStates`, import it from the sprite module and call the function.

### Importing the Function

```javascript
import { fetchAvailableAnimationStates } from './path/to/sprite/module';
```

### Calling the Function

The `fetchAvailableAnimationStates` function does not require any parameters. Simply call it to retrieve the list of available animation states.

```javascript
const animationStates = await fetchAvailableAnimationStates();
console.log(animationStates);
```

### Example Output

The function returns an array of available animation states. Hereâ€™s an example of what the output might look like:

```javascript
[
  'idle',
  'walk',
  'run',
  'attack',
  'jump',
  'fall',
  'hurt',
  'die'
]
```

## Using with Sprite Generation

Once you have the list of available animation states, you can use them when generating sprites. Below is an example of how to use the `generateCharacterSpritesheet` function with a selected animation state.

### Example: Generating a Character Spritesheet

```javascript
import { fetchAvailableAnimationStates, generateCharacterSpritesheet } from './path/to/sprite/module';

async function generateSpriteWithAnimationState() {
  const animationStates = await fetchAvailableAnimationStates();
  const selectedState = animationStates[0]; // 'idle' in this example

  const result = await generateCharacterSpritesheet("A pixelated robot", {
    states: [selectedState],
    framesPerState: 6,
    size: '1024x1024',
    style: 'pixel-art',
    padding: 1,
    direction: 'right'
  });

  console.log(result);
}

generateSpriteWithAnimationState();
```

## Parameters

The `fetchAvailableAnimationStates` function does not accept any parameters.

## Return Value

Returns an array of strings, each representing an available animation state.

## Notes or Considerations

- The list of animation states is predefined and includes common states used in game development.
- Ensure you handle the returned array appropriately in your application to avoid errors.
