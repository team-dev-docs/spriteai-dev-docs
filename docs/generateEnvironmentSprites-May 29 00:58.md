# generateEnvironmentSprites

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function allows you to generate environment sprites for your game or application using AI-powered image generation. This function creates a tileset of environment elements based on a given description and customizable options.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, import it from the spriteAI module and call it with a description of the environment you want to generate.

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from './path/to/spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment elements to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Art style of the generated sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between elements in the tileset (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original`: URL of the originally generated image.
- `tileset`: Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed tileset.
- `metadata`: Object containing information about the generated tileset:
  - `elements`: Number of distinct elements in the tileset.
  - `theme`: Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions`: Width and height of the generated image.
  - `tileData`: Information about the tileset layout (rows, columns, total tiles).

## Examples

### Generate a forest environment tileset

```javascript
const description = "lush forest with trees, bushes, and rocks";
const options = {
  elements: 6,
  theme: "nature",
  style: "pixel-art",
  save: true
};

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
console.log(result.metadata);
console.log(result.tileset); // Base64-encoded image data URL
```

### Generate a sci-fi environment tileset

```javascript
const description = "futuristic space station interior";
const options = {
  elements: 8,
  theme: "sci-fi",
  style: "vector",
  size: "2048x2048"
};

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
console.log(result.metadata);
// Use the result.tileset in your application
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses AI models (DALL-E 3) to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated tilesets are optimized for game environments and follow a specific layout based on the number of elements.
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (OpenAI, axios, sharp) before using this function.
