# generateEnvironmentSprites

## Introduction

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function is a powerful tool for creating environment sprite sheets using AI-powered image generation. This function allows you to quickly generate a set of environment elements based on a given description, which can be used in game development or other visual projects.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, import it from the spriteAI module and call it with a description and optional parameters.

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from './spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites('forest landscape', options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment elements to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Style of the generated sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between elements in the sprite sheet (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original` (string): URL of the original generated image.
- `tileset` (string): Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed sprite sheet.
- `metadata` (object): Information about the generated sprites, including:
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct elements generated.
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions` (object): Width and height of the original image.
  - `tileData` (object): Information about the tile layout in the sprite sheet.

## Examples

### Generate a basic forest environment

```javascript
const forestEnv = await generateEnvironmentSprites('forest landscape');
console.log(forestEnv.metadata);
console.log(forestEnv.tileset);
```

### Generate a desert environment with custom options

```javascript
const desertEnv = await generateEnvironmentSprites('desert oasis', {
  elements: 6,
  size: '2048x2048',
  style: 'vector',
  theme: 'arid',
  save: true
});
console.log(desertEnv.metadata);
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses the DALL-E 3 AI model to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated sprites are optimized for game environments and follow a specific layout (2x2 grid for 4 elements).
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (OpenAI, axios, sharp) before using this function.
