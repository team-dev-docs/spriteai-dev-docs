# generateEnvironmentSprites

## Introduction

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function is part of the SpriteAI module and allows you to create environment sprite sheets using AI-powered image generation. This function is particularly useful for game developers and digital artists who need to quickly generate diverse environmental elements for their projects.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, import it from the SpriteAI module and call it with a description of the environment you want to generate.

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from 'spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment elements to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Art style of the generated sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between elements in the sprite sheet (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original`: URL of the original generated image.
- `tileset`: Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed sprite sheet.
- `metadata`: Object containing information about the generated sprite sheet:
  - `elements`: Number of distinct environment elements.
  - `theme`: Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions`: Width and height of the generated image.
  - `tileData`: Information about the arrangement of tiles in the sprite sheet.

## Examples

### Generate a fantasy forest environment

```javascript
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites("lush fantasy forest with magical elements", {
  elements: 6,
  theme: "fantasy",
  style: "pixel-art"
});

console.log(result.metadata);
console.log(result.tileset); // Base64-encoded image data URL
```

### Generate a sci-fi cityscape and save to disk

```javascript
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites("futuristic sci-fi cityscape", {
  elements: 8,
  theme: "sci-fi",
  style: "vector",
  save: true
});

console.log(`Saved to: ${result.metadata.filename}`);
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses the DALL-E 3 AI model to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated sprites are optimized for game environments and follow a specific layout (grid of elements).
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and credits to use the OpenAI API for image generation.
