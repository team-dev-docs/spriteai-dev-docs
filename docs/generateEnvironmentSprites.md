## 🌟 Spicy Example: Cooking Up a Storm

Let's whip up a forest so magical it would make even the spiciest of wizards jealous:

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from 'spriteAI';

async function createInfernoForest() {
  const options = {
    elements: 8,
    size: '2048x2048',
    style: 'neon-infused-pixel-art',
    theme: 'magical inferno forest',
    save: true
  };

  try {
    const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites('mystical forest with lava rivers, fire-blooming flowers, and phoenixes nesting in obsidian trees', options);
    console.log('🎉🔥 Inferno forest tileset conjured:', result.tileset);
    console.log('✨🌋 Forest of flames secrets revealed:', result.metadata);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('😱💥 Our fire spell backfired:', error);
  }
}

createInfernoForest();
```

## 🌶️ Hot Tips and Considerations: Handle with Asbestos Gloves!

- Your generated images come pre-arranged in a tasty grid layout, perfect for game environments hotter than the surface of the sun!
- Saving your creations? They'll be stored in an 'assets' folder, named after your description. No need to remember file paths - they're branded into your computer like a spicy tattoo!
- This function might take a moment to work its magic – it's crafting art hotter than the core of a volcano, not microwaving instant noodles!
- Make sure you've got the right permissions and API access to use the OpenAI image generation service. We can't cook without a kitchen, and we can't make spicy sprites without the right tools!
