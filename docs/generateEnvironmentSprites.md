# 🌶️ Spice Up Your Game with generateEnvironmentSprites! 🌶️

## 🔥 What's This Hot Function All About? 🔥

`generateEnvironmentSprites` is your ticket to creating sizzling hot environment tilesets using the power of AI! It's like having a master artist and a supercomputer had a baby, and that baby generates game environments. 🎨🖥️👶

## 🚀 How to Unleash the Magic 🚀

First, import this bad boy like you're smuggling exotic spices:

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from './path/to/spicy/sprite/module';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
```

## 🌋 Parameters (aka The Spice Rack) 🌋

- `description` (string, required): Paint a vivid picture with words. The spicier, the better!
- `options` (object, optional): Your secret sauce mix:
  - `elements` (number): How many unique pieces you want (default: 4, but why stop there?)
  - `size` (string): Size matters! (default: "1024x1024")
  - `style` (string): Flavor profile of your sprites (default: "pixel-art", but live dangerously!)
  - `padding` (number): Give your elements some breathing room (default: 1)
  - `theme` (string): Set the mood (default: "fantasy", but let's get wild!)
  - `save` (boolean): Preserve your masterpiece for posterity?

## 🏆 What You Get (The Treasure Chest) 🏆

You'll receive an object hotter than a habanero:
- `original`: URL to the raw, uncut creation
- `tileset`: Base64-encoded image data URL of your spicy tileset
- `metadata`: The secret recipe (info about your generated tileset)

## 🌠 Examples to Ignite Your Imagination 🌠

1. Whip up a basic environment (but who wants basic?):
```javascript
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites("A volcanic lair with lava rivers and obsidian fortresses");
console.log(result.metadata);
console.log(result.tileset);
```

2. Get fancy with a custom inferno:
```javascript
const options = {
  elements: 8,
  size: "2048x2048",
  style: "hyper-realistic",
  theme: "post-apocalyptic",
  save: true
};
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites("A neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape with floating billboards and hover-traffic", options);
console.log(result.metadata);
```
