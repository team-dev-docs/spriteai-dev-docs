# generateEnvironmentSprites

## Introduction

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function is part of the SpriteAI module, designed to create environment sprites for game development using AI-powered image generation. This function allows you to quickly generate tileset images for various game environments, saving time and resources in the asset creation process.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, import it from the SpriteAI module and call it with a description and optional parameters:

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from 'spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites('forest', options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment you want to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment pieces to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Art style of the sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between sprite elements (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original` (string): URL of the original generated image.
- `tileset` (string): Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed tileset.
- `metadata` (object):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment pieces generated.
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions` (object): Width and height of the generated image.
  - `tileData` (object): Information about the tile layout.

## Examples

1. Generate a basic forest environment:

```javascript
const forestEnvironment = await generateEnvironmentSprites('forest');
console.log(forestEnvironment.tileset);
console.log(forestEnvironment.metadata);
```

2. Generate a desert environment with custom options:

```javascript
const desertEnvironment = await generateEnvironmentSprites('desert', {
  elements: 6,
  size: '2048x2048',
  style: 'hand-drawn',
  theme: 'wild-west',
  save: true
});
console.log(desertEnvironment.metadata);
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses the DALL-E 3 AI model to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated tilesets are optimized for game environments and follow a grid layout.
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary API credentials and dependencies (OpenAI, axios, sharp) set up in your project.
