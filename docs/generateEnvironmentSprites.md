# Generate Environment Sprites

## Introduction

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function is a powerful tool that allows you to create environment sprites for your game using AI-powered image generation. This function is part of the SpriteAI module and can be used to generate various environmental elements such as trees, rocks, buildings, or any other objects that make up your game world.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, you need to import it from the SpriteAI module and call it with a description of the environment you want to generate, along with optional configuration parameters.

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from 'spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment elements you want to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment pieces to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Art style of the generated sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between elements in the generated spritesheet (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original` (string): URL of the original generated image.
- `tileset` (string): Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed tileset.
- `metadata` (object): Information about the generated tileset, including:
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment pieces generated.
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions` (object): Width and height of the generated image.
  - `tileData` (object): Information about the tileset layout.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```javascript
const description = "forest environment with trees, rocks, and a small river";
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description);
console.log(result.tileset); // Base64-encoded image data URL
console.log(result.metadata); // Metadata about the generated tileset
```

### Custom Configuration

```javascript
const description = "desert oasis with palm trees and sand dunes";
const options = {
  elements: 6,
  size: "2048x2048",
  style: "hand-drawn",
  theme: "desert",
  save: true
};
const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
console.log(result.original); // URL of the original generated image
console.log(result.metadata.tileData); // Layout information for the tileset
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses DALL-E 3 AI model to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated images are optimized for use as game environment tilesets, with clear separation between elements.
- The `save` option stores the generated tileset in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary API credentials and dependencies (OpenAI, axios, sharp) set up in your project.
