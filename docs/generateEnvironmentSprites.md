# generateEnvironmentSprites

## Introduction

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function is a powerful tool for game developers to create environment sprites using AI-powered image generation. This function allows you to quickly generate a set of environment elements based on a description, making it easier to create diverse and visually appealing game environments.

## Usage

To use the `generateEnvironmentSprites` function, import it from the spriteAI module and call it with a description of the environment you want to generate.

```javascript
import { generateEnvironmentSprites } from './spriteAI';

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
```

## Parameters

- `description` (string, required): A text description of the environment to generate.
- `options` (object, optional):
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct environment pieces to generate (default: 4).
  - `size` (string): Size of the generated image (default: "1024x1024").
  - `style` (string): Art style of the generated sprites (default: "pixel-art").
  - `padding` (number): Padding between elements in the generated tileset (default: 1).
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment (default: "fantasy").
  - `save` (boolean): Whether to save the generated image to disk.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing:

- `original` (string): URL of the original generated image.
- `tileset` (string): Base64-encoded image data URL of the processed tileset.
- `metadata` (object): Information about the generated tileset, including:
  - `elements` (number): Number of distinct elements generated.
  - `theme` (string): Theme of the environment.
  - `dimensions` (object): Width and height of the generated image.
  - `tileData` (object): Information about the tileset layout.

## Examples

### Generate a forest environment tileset

```javascript
const description = "Dense forest with tall trees, bushes, and rocks";
const options = {
  elements: 6,
  theme: "fantasy",
  style: "pixel-art",
};

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
console.log(result.metadata);
console.log(result.tileset); // Base64 encoded image data
```

### Generate and save a desert environment tileset

```javascript
const description = "Arid desert with sand dunes, cacti, and rocky outcrops";
const options = {
  elements: 8,
  theme: "desert",
  style: "vector",
  save: true,
};

const result = await generateEnvironmentSprites(description, options);
console.log(`Tileset saved to: ${result.metadata.filename}`);
```

## Notes and Considerations

- The function uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model to generate images, which may result in varying outputs for the same input.
- Generated tilesets are optimized for game environments and follow a specific layout (grid of elements).
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description.
- The function may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing.
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (OpenAI, axios, sharp) before using this function.
