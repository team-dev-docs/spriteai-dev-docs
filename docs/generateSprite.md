## üé¨ Examples

1. Generate a character sprite sheet that's hotter than a summer in Phoenix:
```javascript
const result = await generateCharacterSpritesheet("A pixelated robot with laser eyes and rocket boots", {
  states: ['idle', 'walk', 'attack', 'fly'],
  framesPerState: 8,
  style: "pixel-art"
});
console.log(result.metadata); // Check out these spicy stats!
console.log(result.spritesheet); // Behold the fiery creation!
```

2. Fetch available sprite styles:
```javascript
const styles = await fetchAvailableSpriteStyles();
console.log("Available styles for your sprite fashion show:", styles);
```

3. Generate environment sprites that'll make your game world spicier than a ghost pepper farm:
```javascript
const environmentResult = await generateEnvironmentSprites("A lush neon forest with glowing mushrooms and floating islands", {
  elements: 6,
  theme: "sci-fi-nature",
  style: "pixel-art"
});
console.log(environmentResult.metadata); // Check out this hot environment!
console.log(environmentResult.tileset); // Caution: Hot tiles ahead!
```

## üß† Notes or Considerations
- Our functions use AI models (DALL-E 3 and GPT) to generate and analyze images. It's like having a team of tiny artists living in your computer!
- Generated sprites are optimized for the specified animation states and follow a grid layout based on the number of frames and states. It's like Tetris, but for animations!
- The `generateCharacterSpritesheet` function is designed for character animations, while `generateEnvironmentSprites` is for creating environment tilesets. Choose your fighter!
- When saving images, they are stored in an 'assets' folder with a filename based on the description. It's like a cozy home for your sprites!
- The functions may take some time to complete due to API calls and image processing. Good things come to those who wait!
- Available sprite styles and animation states are predefined but can be expanded in future updates. The sprite fashion world is ever-evolving!
- Consider using the `fetchAvailableSpriteStyles` function to ensure you're using a supported style before generating sprites. Don't be a fashion faux pas in the sprite world!

Now go forth and create some pixel-perfect magic that's so hot, it'll melt your players' screens! üåü‚ú®üî•
