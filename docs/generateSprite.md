# batchProcessSprites

## Brief Description

`batchProcessSprites` is a function that allows for concurrent generation of multiple sprites based on provided descriptions. This function leverages the `generateSprite` capability to create multiple sprites in parallel, improving performance when generating a large number of sprites.

## Usage

To use `batchProcessSprites`, import it from the sprite module and call it with an array of sprite descriptions.

```javascript
import { sprite } from './path/to/sprite/module';

const descriptions = [
  "A pixelated robot",
  "A cartoon cat",
  "A medieval knight"
];

const results = await sprite.batchProcessSprites(descriptions);
```

## Parameters

- `descriptions` (array of strings, required): An array containing text descriptions of the characters to generate.

## Return Value

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of objects, each containing:

- `messages`: JSON object with frameHeight and frameWidth information.
- `image`: Base64-encoded image data URL of the generated sprite sheet.

The array will be in the same order as the input descriptions.

## Examples

1. Generate multiple sprites concurrently:

```javascript
const descriptions = [
  "A futuristic spaceship",
  "A tropical bird",
  "An ancient tree"
];

const results = await sprite.batchProcessSprites(descriptions);

results.forEach((result, index) => {
  console.log(`Sprite ${index + 1}:`);
  console.log(result.messages);
  console.log(result.image);
});
```

2. Process sprites with custom options:

```javascript
const descriptions = [
  "A steampunk airship",
  "A cyberpunk character"
];

const customOptions = {
  size: "512x512",
  save: true
};

const results = await sprite.batchProcessSprites(descriptions.map(desc => ({
  description: desc,
  options: customOptions
})));

console.log(`Generated ${results.length} sprites`);
```

## Notes or Considerations

- This function uses `Promise.all` to process multiple sprites concurrently, which can significantly improve performance when generating a large number of sprites.
- The function inherits the same considerations as `generateSprite`, including the use of AI models for image generation and analysis.
- Processing time may vary depending on the number and complexity of the sprite descriptions.
- Ensure your system has sufficient resources to handle concurrent sprite generation, especially for large batches.
- The function returns results in the same order as the input descriptions, making it easy to match results with their corresponding inputs.
- Error handling for individual sprite generation is managed within the `generateSprite` function. If an error occurs for a specific sprite, it will be reflected in the corresponding result object.
