# getUniqueColors Documentation

## Brief Description
üé® `getUniqueColors` is a powerful function that analyzes an image and returns an array of unique colors present in the image, excluding fully transparent pixels. It's like a color detective, sniffing out every distinct hue in your digital masterpiece!

## Usage
To unleash the color-finding prowess of `getUniqueColors`, import it from its cozy module home. Then, call it with the path to your image file and watch the magic unfold!

```javascript
import { getUniqueColors } from './path/to/module';
```

## Parameters
- `imagePath` (string, required): The file path to the image you want to analyze. Think of it as the treasure map to your color goldmine!
- `options` (object, optional): An optional object for additional configuration. Currently not used, but it's like a Swiss Army knife - ready for future adventures!

## Return Value
The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of integers. Each integer represents a unique color found in the image, encoded as RGBA. It's like getting a secret code for each color!

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.png';
const uniqueColors = await getUniqueColors(imagePath);
console.log(uniqueColors);
// Output: [16777215, 0, 16711680, ...] (example values)
// Look at all those numbers! Each one is a color in disguise.
```

### Using with Options (for future extensibility)
```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.png';
const options = {}; // Currently not used, but prepared for future features
const uniqueColors = await getUniqueColors(imagePath, options);
console.log(uniqueColors);
// Who knows what cool features these options might unlock in the future?
```

## Notes or Considerations
- üìö The function uses the Jimp library to read and process images. Make sure Jimp is installed in your project, or you'll be seeing more errors than colors!
- üëª Fully transparent pixels (alpha = 0) are ignored in the color analysis. They're like the ghosts of the color world - present, but unseen.
- üßÆ The returned color values are integers representing RGBA colors. You might need to put on your math hat and convert these to other formats (like hex) for certain use cases.
- üê¢ Large images may take longer to process due to the pixel-by-pixel scanning approach. It's thorough, but not exactly Usain Bolt.
- ‚è≥ This function is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so remember to use `await` or `.then()` when calling it. Don't let it catch you unprepared!

Happy color hunting! May your palettes be ever vibrant and your transparencies always intentional. üåà‚ú®
