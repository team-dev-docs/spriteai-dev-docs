  try {
    // Generate a sprite
    const generatedSprite = await ai.generateSprite('player', 32, 32);
    console.log('Sprite successfully generated:', generatedSprite);

    // Load an existing sprite
    const loadedSprite = await ai.loadSprite('path/to/sprite.png');
    console.log('Sprite successfully loaded:', loadedSprite);

    // Save a sprite
    await ai.saveSprite(generatedSprite, 'path/to/save/sprite.png');
    console.log('Sprite saved successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred during sprite operations:', error);
  }
}

// Call the async function
spriteOperations();
```
