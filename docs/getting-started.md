# Getting Started with A/B Testing

Welcome to our A/B Testing documentation! This guide will walk you through the process of integrating and using our A/B testing tool in your projects.

## Installation

To begin using our A/B testing tool, you'll need to install it in your project directory. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install abtest-tool
```

## Basic Usage

Once the A/B testing tool is installed, you can start leveraging its features in your project. Here's a quick example demonstrating the main functionalities:

```javascript
const ABTest = require('abtest-tool');

// Initialize a new A/B test
const test = new ABTest('button-color-test');

// Define variations
test.addVariation('A', { buttonColor: 'blue' });
test.addVariation('B', { buttonColor: 'green' });

// Assign a user to a variation
const userId = 'user123';
const assignedVariation = test.assignUser(userId);

console.log(`User ${userId} assigned to variation: ${assignedVariation}`);

// Use the assigned variation in your application
if (assignedVariation === 'A') {
  // Apply blue button color
} else {
  // Apply green button color
}

// Track conversion
test.trackConversion(userId);
```

## Key Features

Our A/B testing tool offers a range of powerful features:

1. **Test Creation**: Easily create new A/B tests with `new ABTest(testName)`.
2. **Variation Definition**: Define multiple variations for each test using `addVariation(variationName, properties)`.
3. **User Assignment**: Consistently assign users to variations with `assignUser(userId)`.
4. **Conversion Tracking**: Track conversions for each variation using `trackConversion(userId)`.
