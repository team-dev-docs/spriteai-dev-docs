// Initialize a new SpriteAI instance
const ai = new spriteAI.SpriteAI();

// Generate a sprite
ai.generateSprite('player', 32, 32)
  .then(sprite => {
    console.log('Sprite successfully generated:', sprite);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Sprite generation encountered an error:', error);
  });

// Load an existing sprite
ai.loadSprite('path/to/sprite.png')
  .then(sprite => {
    console.log('Sprite successfully loaded:', sprite);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Sprite loading encountered an error:', error);
  });

// Save a sprite
ai.saveSprite(sprite, 'path/to/save/sprite.png')
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Sprite saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Sprite saving encountered an error:', error);
  });
```
