# Image Processing Utilities

This document describes the various image processing utility functions available in index.js. These functions can be used in combination with the main sprite generation functions to enhance and modify generated sprites.

## rotateSpritesheet(inputBuffer, degrees)

Rotates a spritesheet by the specified number of degrees.

- Parameters:
  - inputBuffer: Buffer containing the image data
  - degrees: Number of degrees to rotate the image
- Returns: Promise resolving to a Buffer containing the rotated image data

## tintSprite(inputBuffer, color)

Applies a color tint to a sprite.

- Parameters:
  - inputBuffer: Buffer containing the image data
  - color: Color to apply as tint
- Returns: Promise resolving to a Buffer containing the tinted image data

## createParticleEffect(imageBuffer, particleCount)

Generates particle effects based on a source sprite.

- Parameters:
  - imageBuffer: Buffer containing the source image data
  - particleCount: Number of particles to generate (default: 10)
- Returns: Promise resolving to an array of Buffers, each containing a particle image

## flipSprite(imageBuffer, direction)

Flips a sprite horizontally or vertically.

- Parameters:
  - imageBuffer: Buffer containing the image data
  - direction: 'horizontal' or 'vertical' (default: 'horizontal')
- Returns: Promise resolving to a Buffer containing the flipped image data

## createColorCyclingAnimation(imageBuffer, colorShift)

Creates a color cycling animation effect.

- Parameters:
  - imageBuffer: Buffer containing the image data
  - colorShift: Amount of color shift per frame (default: 30)
- Returns: Promise resolving to an array of Buffers, each containing a frame of the animation

## combineSprites(spriteBufferA, spriteBufferB, position)

Combines two sprites into a single image.

- Parameters:
  - spriteBufferA: Buffer containing the first sprite's image data
  - spriteBufferB: Buffer containing the second sprite's image data
  - position: How to combine the sprites ('overlay', 'side-by-side', or 'stacked')
- Returns: Promise resolving to a Buffer containing the combined image data

These utility functions can be used to enhance sprites generated by the main sprite generation functions. For example, you could generate a sprite, rotate it, apply a tint, and then combine it with another sprite to create complex compositions.
