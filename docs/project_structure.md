# Project Structure Documentation

## Overview

This project is structured to facilitate the generation of sprite sheets using Node.js. The main components of the project are:

1. `index.js`: The entry point of the application
2. `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies
3. Utility functions: Organized in separate files to handle specific tasks in the sprite generation process

## Main Files

### index.js

The `index.js` file serves as the main entry point for the sprite sheet generation process. It orchestrates the overall flow of the application by:

1. Parsing command-line arguments
2. Loading configuration settings
3. Calling utility functions to process images
4. Generating the final sprite sheet
5. Outputting the result and any necessary metadata

### package.json

The `package.json` file contains essential information about the project, including:

1. Project name, version, and description
2. Dependencies required for the project
3. Scripts for running, testing, and building the application
4. Author and license information

## Utility Functions

Utility functions are organized into separate files based on their specific roles in the sprite generation process. This modular approach enhances maintainability and reusability. Key utility functions may include:

1. `imageProcessing.js`: Functions for loading, resizing, and manipulating individual images
2. `spriteArrangement.js`: Algorithms for efficiently arranging sprites on the sheet
3. `metadataGeneration.js`: Functions for creating and formatting metadata about the generated sprite sheet
4. `fileIO.js`: Utilities for reading input files and writing output files
5. `configParser.js`: Functions for parsing and validating configuration options

These utility functions contribute to the sprite generation process by breaking down complex tasks into manageable, reusable components. This separation of concerns allows for easier testing, maintenance, and future enhancements to the project.
