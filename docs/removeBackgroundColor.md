# removeBackgroundColor Documentation

## Brief Description
The `removeBackgroundColor` function removes a specified color from an image, making it transparent based on a given threshold.

## Usage
To use `removeBackgroundColor`, import it from the appropriate module and call it with the required parameters.

```javascript
import { removeBackgroundColor } from './imageProcessing';
```

## Parameters
- `inputPath` (string, required): Path to the input image file.
- `outputPath` (string, required): Path where the processed image will be saved.
- `targetColor` (string, required): The color to be removed, specified as a CSS color string (e.g., '#FFFFFF').
- `colorThreshold` (number, optional): Tolerance for color matching. Default is 0.
- `options` (object, optional): Additional options for image processing.

## Return Value
The function returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the image writing operation.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
await removeBackgroundColor('input.png', 'output.png', '#FFFFFF');
```

### With Color Threshold
```javascript
await removeBackgroundColor('input.png', 'output.png', '#FFFFFF', 10);
```

## Notes or Considerations
- The function uses the Jimp library for image processing.
- Color matching is based on the `Jimp.colorDiff` method, which calculates the difference between colors.
- Pixels with a color difference less than or equal to the threshold are made transparent.
- Large images may require more processing time.
- Ensure that the input file exists and the output path is writable.
