# THANKS FOR WATCHIN THE DEMO ANNA

## Introduction

SpriteAI is a powerful tool designed to generate and manipulate character spritesheets and other game-related assets using AI-powered image generation and processing techniques. This project leverages the OpenAI API and various image processing libraries to create pixel-art character animations, environment sprites, item sprites, and more.

## Key Features

* Generate character spritesheets with customizable animation states

* Create environment tileset sprites

* Produce item sprite collections

* Generate isometric sprites

* Create animated emojis

* Remove background colors from images

## Main Components

### Character Spritesheet Generation

The `generateCharacterSpritesheet` function allows users to create detailed character spritesheets based on text descriptions. It supports various animation states, frame counts, and styling options.

Example usage:

```javascript
const description = 'a cute dragon';
const options = {
  states: ['idle', 'walk', 'run'],
  framesPerState: 4,
  size: '512x512',
  style: 'pixel-art'
};

const result = await generateCharacterSpritesheet(description, options);
```

### Environment Sprite Generation

The `generateEnvironmentSprites` function creates tilesets for game environments based on text descriptions.

### Item Sprite Generation

The `generateItemSprites` function produces collections of item sprites suitable for game inventories or pickups.

### Additional Features

* `generateIsometric`: Creates isometric sprite images

* `generatePixelArt`: Generates pixel art sprites

* `generateAnimatedEmoji`: Produces 4-frame animated emojis

* `removeBackgroundColor`: Removes specific background colors from images

## Getting Started

To use SpriteAI in your project, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install spriteai
```

Then, import and use the desired functions in your JavaScript code:

```javascript
import { generateCharacterSpritesheet } from 'spriteai';

// Use the functions as needed
```

## Technology Stack

* Node.js

* OpenAI API (DALL-E 3)

* Sharp and Jimp for image processing

* Axios for HTTP requests

## Conclusion

SpriteAI offers a comprehensive suite of tools for game developers and digital artists to quickly generate high-quality sprite assets using AI. By automating the sprite creation process, it significantly reduces the time and effort required in game asset development.
