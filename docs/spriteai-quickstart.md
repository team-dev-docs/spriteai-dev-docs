# SpriteAI Quickstart Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the SpriteAI Quickstart Guide! This guide will help you get started with SpriteAI, a powerful tool for generating and manipulating game sprites using artificial intelligence.

## Installation

To install SpriteAI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:

   ```
   pip install spriteai
   ```

## Basic Usage

Here's a quick example to generate a simple sprite:

```python
from spriteai import SpriteGenerator

# Initialize the generator
generator = SpriteGenerator()

# Generate a basic sprite
sprite = generator.create_sprite(theme='fantasy', size=(64, 64))

# Save the sprite
sprite.save('my_first_sprite.png')
```

## Key Features

### 1. Theme-based Generation

SpriteAI can generate sprites based on various themes:

```python
themes = ['fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'medieval', 'modern']
for theme in themes:
    sprite = generator.create_sprite(theme=theme)
    sprite.save(f'{theme}_sprite.png')
```

### 2. Customization

You can customize various aspects of your sprites:

```python
custom_sprite = generator.create_sprite(
    theme='fantasy',
    color_scheme='dark',
    complexity=0.7,
    style='pixel_art'
)
```

### 3. Batch Generation

Generate multiple sprites at once:

```python
batch = generator.create_batch(
    count=10,
    theme='sci-fi',
    size=(32, 32)
)

for i, sprite in enumerate(batch):
    sprite.save(f'sci_fi_sprite_{i}.png')
```
