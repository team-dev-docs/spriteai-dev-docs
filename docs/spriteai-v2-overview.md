# SpriteAI v2 Overview

## Introduction

SpriteAI v2 is an advanced sprite generation and manipulation library, building upon the success of its predecessor. This powerful tool enables developers to programmatically create, modify, and manage sprites for game development and other graphical applications.

## Key Features

1. **Enhanced Sprite Generation**: Create complex sprites with improved AI algorithms

2. **Advanced Manipulation**: Apply sophisticated transformations and effects to sprites

3. **Animation Support**: Generate and manage sprite animations with ease

4. **Performance Optimizations**: Faster processing and reduced memory footprint

5. **Expanded File Format Support**: Work with a wider range of image formats

## Getting Started

To begin using SpriteAI v2, install it via npm:

```bash
npm install spriteai-v2
```

For detailed installation instructions and basic usage, please refer to our Getting Started guide.

## Basic Usage

Here's a quick example demonstrating the core functionality of SpriteAI v2:

```javascript
const SpriteAI = require('spriteai-v2');

// Initialize a new SpriteAI instance
const ai = new SpriteAI.SpriteAI();

// Generate a sprite
ai.generateSprite('player', 64, 64, { style: 'pixel-art' })
  .then(sprite => {
    console.log('Sprite successfully generated:', sprite);
    return ai.saveSprite(sprite, 'path/to/save/player.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Sprite saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  });
```

## Key Concepts

### Sprite Generation

SpriteAI v2 uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate sprites based on your specifications. You can control various aspects such as size, style, and theme.

### Sprite Manipulation

Once a sprite is generated or loaded, you can apply a wide range of transformations and effects, including:

* Resizing and scaling

* Color adjustments

* Applying filters

* Rotating and flipping

### Animation

SpriteAI v2 introduces robust support for creating and managing sprite animations. You can easily generate animation frames, set timing, and export animated sprites.

## Advanced Features

For more complex use cases, SpriteAI v2 offers:

* Batch processing of sprites

* Custom shader support for unique visual effects

* Integration with popular game engines

* Real-time sprite generation and modification

## API Reference

For a complete list of methods, parameters, and return types, please consult our API Reference documentation.

## Performance Considerations

While SpriteAI v2 is optimized for performance, keep in mind that complex operations on large sprites or batches may require significant processing power. Consider using worker threads for heavy tasks in production environments.
