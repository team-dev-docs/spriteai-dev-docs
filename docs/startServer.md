# startServer Method

## Overview

The `startServer` method is a key function in the SpriteAI v2 package that initializes and runs an HTTP server to serve sprite-related content. This method is designed to facilitate the display and interaction with generated sprites in a web environment.

## Function Signature

```javascript
startServer(port = 3000, imageFile = 'sprite.png', frameCount = 12)
```

### Parameters

- `port` (optional): The port number on which the server will listen. Default is 3000.
- `imageFile` (optional): The name of the sprite image file to be served. Default is 'sprite.png'.
- `frameCount` (optional): The number of frames in the sprite animation. Default is 12.

## Functionality

The `startServer` method performs the following tasks:

1. Creates an HTTP server using Node.js `http` module.
2. Handles incoming requests and serves appropriate content based on the requested URL.
3. Supports serving HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and image files.
4. Provides a specific endpoint ('/imageFile') to return JSON data about the sprite image and frame count.

## Usage

To use the `startServer` method in your SpriteAI v2 project:

```javascript
import { startServer } from 'spriteai-v2';

// Start the server with default settings
startServer();

// Or, start the server with custom settings
startServer(8080, 'custom-sprite.png', 8);
```

## Server Behavior

1. **Root URL ('/')**: Serves the 'index.html' file from the package directory.
2. **'/imageFile' endpoint**: Returns a JSON object containing the `imageFile` name and `frameCount`.
3. **Static file serving**: Handles requests for other static files (JS, CSS, images) from the package directory.

## Error Handling

- The server handles 404 (Not Found) errors for non-existent files.
- Server errors (500) are handled and logged appropriately.

## MIME Types

The server supports various MIME types, including:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- PNG, JPG, GIF
- SVG
- JSON

## Conclusion

The `startServer` method is crucial for showcasing and interacting with sprites generated by SpriteAI v2. It provides a simple yet flexible way to serve your sprite content in a web-based environment, making it easier to integrate SpriteAI-generated sprites into web applications or demos.
