# coding-languages.scss

## Overview

The `coding-languages.scss` file is a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet that contains styling rules for specific language-related elements in a Docusaurus template. This file focuses on the appearance of Markdown language elements within the documentation.

The file currently contains a single rule set for the `.language-markdown` class, which is likely used to style code blocks or inline code snippets that contain Markdown syntax.

## How can I customize this for my use case

To customize the `coding-languages.scss` file for your specific needs, you can modify the existing rules or add new ones. Here are some ways you can adapt this file:

1. Adjust the `.language-markdown` class:
   - Change the `opacity` value to make Markdown syntax more or less visible.
   - Modify the `height` and `width` properties to alter the size of Markdown code blocks.
   - Adjust the `overflow` property to change how content behaves when it exceeds the container's dimensions.

2. Add styles for other language classes:
   - Create new rule sets for other language-specific classes, such as `.language-javascript`, `.language-python`, etc.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     .language-javascript {
       background-color: #f7df1e;
       color: #000000;
     }
     ```

3. Implement syntax highlighting:
   - Add rules to highlight different parts of the code syntax, such as keywords, strings, or comments.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     .language-markdown {
       .keyword {
         color: #0000ff;
       }
       .string {
         color: #008000;
       }
     }
     ```

4. Create a common style for all code blocks:
   - Use a more general selector to apply styles to all language classes.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     [class^="language-"] {
       font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
       border-radius: 4px;
       padding: 1em;
     }
     ```

5. Add responsive designs:
   - Use media queries to adjust the appearance of code blocks on different screen sizes.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     @media (max-width: 768px) {
       .language-markdown {
         width: 100%;
         height: auto;
       }
     }
     ```

Remember to test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work well with your Docusaurus template and provide a good user experience across different devices and browsers.
