# Custom Templates Styling (SCSS)

This file contains SCSS styles specifically for custom templates used in the application.

## File Location

`src/css/custom-templates.scss`

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to define styles that are unique to custom templates, separate from the main application styles. This separation allows for easier maintenance and organization of template-specific styles.

## Usage

To add or modify styles for custom templates:

1. Open the `custom-templates.scss` file.
2. Locate the relevant section or create a new one for your template.
3. Add or modify the SCSS rules as needed.
4. Compile the SCSS to CSS for use in the application.

## Best Practices

- Use semantic class names that describe the purpose or content of the element.
- Leverage SCSS features such as variables, mixins, and nesting for efficient and maintainable code.
- Follow the established naming conventions and structure of the existing styles.
- Ensure cross-device and cross-browser compatibility by thoroughly testing changes on various platforms.
- Familiarize yourself with SCSS fundamentals to maximize the benefits of its advanced features, including variables, mixins, and nesting capabilities.

## Example

```scss
.custom-template {
  .header {
    font-size: 24px;
    color: $primary-color;
  }

  .content {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: $light-gray;
  }
}
```

## Notes

- This file is specifically for custom template styles. For global styles, use the appropriate global SCSS files.
- Always consider the impact of your changes on the overall design and user experience of the application.
