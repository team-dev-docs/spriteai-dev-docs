# custom.scss

## Overview

The `custom.scss` file is the sizzling hot sauce of your Docusaurus-based project! üå∂Ô∏è This spicy stylesheet imports a fiery blend of SCSS modules and Tailwind CSS utilities to create a flavor explosion for your entire site. It's the secret recipe that brings the heat to your design!

Key ingredients in this flavorful file include:

1. Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities - the perfect seasoning blend
2. Custom design preferences and secondary colors - adding that extra kick
3. Component-specific styles (e.g., sidebar, navbar, footer) - like individual spices in your dish
4. Typography styles for headings, paragraphs, and prose - the textual hot sauce
5. Styles for specific features like the searchbar, table of contents, and chatbot - the spicy toppings
6. Styles for different page types (e.g., landing page, blog, cards) - various dishes in your spicy menu

## How can I customize this for my usecase

Ready to turn up the heat on your `custom.scss`? Here's how to customize it and make your site sizzle:

1. **Tailwind CSS customization**: 
   - Spice up the Tailwind configuration file to change default styles, add new utility classes, or extend existing ones. It's like creating your own custom hot sauce!

2. **Design preferences**: 
   - Turn up the heat in `design-preferences.scss` and `secondaryColors.scss` to adjust color schemes, fonts, and other global design elements. Make your site too hot to handle!

3. **Component-specific styles**: 
   - Add some flavor to individual components by modifying or creating new SCSS files (e.g., `sidebar.scss`, `navbar.scss`). It's like adding different peppers to each part of your dish!

4. **Typography**: 
   - Spice up your text by adjusting `headings-and-paragraphs.scss` and `prose.scss`. Make your words so hot they jump off the page!

5. **Feature-specific styles**: 
   - Bring the heat to specific features by modifying files like `searchbar.scss`, `table-of-contents.scss`, or `chatbot.scss`. Each feature can have its own unique spicy kick!

6. **Page-type styles**: 
   - Give different page types their own flavor profile by editing files such as `landingpage.scss`, `blog.scss`, or `cards.scss`. Every page type can be a different spicy dish!

7. **Add new imports**: 
   - Throw some new spices into the mix! Create and import new SCSS modules for additional custom styles or components specific to your project.

8. **Remove unused imports**: 
   - Cleaning out the spice rack? If certain features or components aren't being used, remove their corresponding import statements to keep your stylesheet lean and mean.

9. **Order of imports**: 
   - Adjust the order of imports like you're layering flavors in a spicy dish. This ensures proper cascading of CSS rules and lets you override specific styles as needed.

Remember to rebuild your project after making changes to see your site in all its spicy glory! üî•
