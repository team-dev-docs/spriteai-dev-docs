# design-preferences.scss

## Overview

The `design-preferences.scss` file is a crucial component of the open-source Docusaurus template's styling system. It defines a comprehensive color palette using SCSS variables, allowing for easy customization and consistent theming across the project.

This file contains five main color sets (color-1 to color-5), each with a base color and 12 variations. These color sets provide a wide range of shades that can be used throughout the template for various UI elements, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

## How can I customize this for my usecase

To customize the `design-preferences.scss` file for your specific use case, follow these steps:

1. **Modify base colors**: 
   - Locate the base color variables (e.g., `$color-1`, `$color-2`, etc.).
   - Replace the hexadecimal or rgba values with your desired colors.

2. **Adjust color variations**:
   - For each base color, there are 12 variations (e.g., `$color-1-1` to `$color-1-12`).
   - You can modify these variations to create your own custom color palette.
   - Ensure a good contrast ratio between variations for accessibility.

3. **Add new color sets**:
   - If needed, you can add new color sets by following the existing pattern.
   - For example, you could add `$color-6` and its variations.

4. **Use variables in your styles**:
   - In your other SCSS or CSS files, use these color variables to maintain consistency.
   - For example: `background-color: $color-1-3;`

5. **Consider creating theme variations**:
   - You could create multiple versions of this file for different themes (e.g., light and dark modes).

6. **Document your changes**:
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of each color or any specific usage guidelines.

7. **Test your changes**:
   - After modifying the colors, thoroughly test your site to ensure all elements look as intended with the new color scheme.

By customizing this file, you can easily adapt the template's color scheme to match your brand or design preferences, ensuring a unique and cohesive look for your Docusaurus site.
