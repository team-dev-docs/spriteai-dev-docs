This guide provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while using SpriteAI. If you're experiencing problems, please review the following sections for potential solutions.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Sprite Generation Fails

If you're having trouble generating sprites, try the following:

1. Ensure you're using the correct syntax:

   ```javascript
   ai.generateSprite('spriteName', width, height)
   ```

2. Check that the width and height are valid positive integers.
3. Verify that you have sufficient memory and processing power for the sprite size you're requesting.

### Sprite Loading Errors

If you're encountering issues when loading sprites:

1. Double-check the file path:

   ```javascript
   ai.loadSprite('path/to/sprite.png')
   ```

2. Ensure the file exists at the specified location.
3. Verify that the file is a valid image format supported by SpriteAI (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

### Sprite Saving Problems

If you're having difficulties saving sprites:

1. Confirm you're using the correct method:

   ```javascript
   ai.saveSprite(sprite, 'path/to/save/sprite.png')
   ```

2. Ensure you have write permissions for the target directory.
3. Check that the sprite object is valid and not null or undefined.
