# SpriteAI Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues users might encounter when using the SpriteAI library and provides solutions for installation problems, API usage errors, and performance optimization tips.

## Installation Problems

### Issue: Unable to install SpriteAI

1. Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or higher installed.
2. Check your internet connection.
3. Try clearing your npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
4. Attempt installation again: `npm install spriteai`

### Issue: Missing dependencies

If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies:

1. Check the `package.json` file to ensure all required dependencies are listed.
2. Run `npm install` to install missing dependencies.
3. If issues persist, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.

## API Usage Errors

### Error: Invalid API Key

1. Ensure you have set up your OpenAI API key correctly.
2. Check that the API key is properly configured in your environment variables or passed as an option to the SpriteAI constructor.

### Error: Exceeded rate limits

1. Implement proper rate limiting in your application.
2. Consider using a queueing system for large batch operations.
3. Contact OpenAI to request increased rate limits if necessary.

### Error: Unsupported image format

1. Ensure you are using supported image formats (PNG, JPEG).
2. Check that the input image is not corrupted.
3. Try converting the image to a different format before processing.

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently used sprites and avoid unnecessary API calls.

2. **Batch Processing**: When generating multiple sprites, use batch processing methods to reduce API calls and improve overall performance.

3. **Image Optimization**: Use the `sharp` library to optimize generated images for web use, reducing file sizes without significant quality loss.

4. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize Node.js's asynchronous nature to process multiple sprites in parallel when possible.

5. **Memory Management**: For large-scale operations, implement proper memory management techniques to avoid out-of-memory errors.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues in production environments.

7. **API Usage Monitoring**: Regularly monitor your API usage to optimize costs and prevent unexpected billing issues.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Generated sprites are blurry or low quality

1. Ensure you are requesting an appropriate image size for your use case.
2. Use the `pixelPerfectScale` function to upscale pixel art without losing sharpness.
3. Experiment with different prompts to achieve desired clarity and detail.

### Issue: Inconsistent sprite sizes in animations

1. Use the `generateSpriteMetadata` function to ensure consistent frame sizes.
2. Implement custom post-processing to standardize sprite dimensions if necessary.

### Issue: High memory usage

1. Process sprites in smaller batches.
2. Implement garbage collection calls after processing large batches.
3. Use streams for handling large files or datasets.
