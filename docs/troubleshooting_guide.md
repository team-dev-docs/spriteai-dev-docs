  # SpriteAI Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues you may encounter when using spriteAI and provides step-by-step solutions.

## Sprite Generation Issues

### Issue: Sprite is not generating

If you're having trouble generating a sprite:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify you have a valid OpenAI API key configured
3. Try simplifying your sprite description
4. Increase the timeout if the request is timing out

### Issue: Generated sprite is low quality

To improve sprite quality:

1. Use more detailed descriptions
2. Experiment with different prompt formulations
3. Increase the resolution in the options (e.g. `size: "1024x1024"`)
4. Try multiple iterations and select the best result

### Issue: Inconsistent sprite style

For more consistent sprite styles:

1. Use consistent terminology in your descriptions
2. Specify a particular art style in your prompt
3. Use the `generatePixelArt` method for pixel art consistency
4. Leverage style transfer techniques with `createElementalVariation`

## Image Processing Problems

### Issue: Background removal not working properly

If background removal is ineffective:

1. Ensure the background color is specified correctly (e.g. "#FFFFFF" for white)
2. Adjust the `colorThreshold` parameter to allow for slight color variations
3. Pre-process the image to have a more uniform background
4. Use the `addOutline` method to create a clear sprite boundary

### Issue: Sprite sheet splitting fails

When sprite sheet splitting doesn't work as expected:

1. Verify the `columns` and `rows` parameters match your spritesheet layout
2. Ensure your spritesheet has uniform frame sizes
3. Check if there's padding between frames and adjust calculations accordingly
4. Use `generateSpriteMetadata` to automatically detect optimal frame dimensions

## Integration Challenges

### Issue: Difficulty integrating with game engines

To improve game engine integration:

1. Ensure you're exporting sprites in a compatible format (usually PNG)
2. Use the `createPixelPerfectScale` method for clean scaling in pixel-based games
3. Leverage `generateSpriteMetadata` to automatically generate frame data
4. For animated sprites, use `createSpriteAnimation` to generate frame sequences

### Issue: Performance problems with large sprites

If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Reduce sprite dimensions or use lower resolution options
2. Implement sprite atlasing to combine multiple sprites into one texture
3. Use `optimizePalette` to reduce color depth for pixel art sprites
4. Consider using sprite instancing for repeated elements

## Advanced Feature Troubleshooting

### Issue: Weather effects not rendering properly

If weather effects aren't displaying correctly:

1. Adjust the `intensity` parameter to make the effect more visible
2. Increase the `frames` count for smoother animations
3. Experiment with different `type` options (e.g. 'rain', 'snow', 'fog')
4. Ensure your rendering engine supports alpha channel for particle effects

### Issue: Lighting variations look unnatural

To improve lighting effects:

1. Fine-tune the `intensity` and `ambient` parameters
2. Experiment with different `lightColor` values
3. Toggle the `shadows` option for more depth
4. Use `colorize: true` for more dramatic lighting changes

### Issue: Elemental variations not distinctive enough

If elemental sprite variations aren't sufficiently unique:

1. Increase the effect intensity in the `elementalEffects` object
2. Add more element-specific processing steps
3. Combine multiple effects (e.g. tint + particles + distortion)
4. Create custom elemental effect functions for more control

## General Troubleshooting Steps

If you encounter any other issues:

1. Check the spriteAI documentation for updates or known issues
2. Verify you're using the latest version of the library
3. Log intermediate results to pinpoint where the problem occurs
4. Reach out to the spriteAI community or support channels for assistance

Remember to always handle errors gracefully in your application and provide meaningful feedback to users when sprite generation or processing fails.
